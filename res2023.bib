	abstract = {The Super DIOS project, which is an improved version of DIOS (Diffuse Intergalactic Oxygen Surveyor), is one of the candidates for Japan’s future scientific satellites, to be launched after 2030. The main scientific objective of the project is to unravel the flow of energy and metal cycles at various scales from galaxies, galaxy clusters to the warm-hot intergalactic medium along the Cosmic Web. The primary goal is the quantification of baryons, especially the unidentified “dark baryons”. Super DIOS will have a wide field of view of \$\${\textbackslash}sim\$\$1 degree, with an angular resolution of \$\${\textbackslash}sim\$\$15 arcseconds and high energy resolution (\$\$E/dE {\textgreater} 1000\$\$). The detector will be a 30 kilo-pixel array of Transition Edge sensor (TES) with a micro-wave SQUID multiplexer read-out system. In this paper, we report on the scientific concept of Super DIOS and the status of its newly developed technologies.},

	abstract = {The majority of the ordinary matter in the local Universe has been heated by strong structure formation shocks and resides in a largely unexplored hot, diffuse, X-ray emitting plasma that permeates the halos of galaxies, galaxy groups and clusters, and the cosmic web. We propose a next-generation "Cosmic Web Explorer" that will permit a complete and exhaustive understanding of these unseen baryons. This will be the first mission capable to reach the accretion shocks located several times farther than the virial radii of galaxy clusters, and reveal the out-of-equilibrium parts of the intra-cluster medium which are live witnesses to the physics of cosmic accretion. It will also enable a view of the thermodynamics, kinematics, and chemical composition of the circumgalactic medium in galaxies with masses similar to the Milky Way, at the same level of detail that \$Athena\$ will unravel for the virialized regions of massive galaxy clusters, delivering a transformative understanding of the evolution of those galaxies in which most of the stars and metals in the Universe were formed. Finally, the proposed X-ray satellite will connect the dots of the large-scale structure by mapping, at high spectral resolution, as much as 100\% of the diffuse gas hotter than \$10{\textasciicircum}6\$ K that fills the filaments of the cosmic web at low redshifts, down to an over-density of 1, both in emission and in absorption against the ubiquitous cosmic X-ray background, surveying at least 1600 square degrees over 5 years in orbit. This requires a large effective area ({\textasciitilde}10 m\${\textasciicircum}2\$ at 1 keV) over a large field of view (\${\textbackslash}sim1\$ deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$), a megapixel cryogenic microcalorimeter array providing integral field spectroscopy with a resolving power \$E/{\textbackslash}Delta E\$ = 2000 at 0.6 keV and a spatial resolution of 5 arcsec in the soft X-ray band, and a low and stable instrumental background ensuring high sensitivity to faint, extended emission.},

	abstract = {The X-ray bright bubbles at the Galactic Center provide an opportunity to understand the effects of feedback on galaxy evolution. The shells of the eROSITA bubbles show enhanced X-ray emission over the sky background. Previously, these shells were assumed to have a single temperature component and to trace the shock-heated lower-temperature halo gas. Using Suzaku observations, we show that the X-ray emission of the shells is more complex and best described by a two-temperature thermal model: one component close to the Galaxy's virial temperature and the other at super-virial temperatures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that temperatures of the virial and super-virial components are similar in the shells and in the ambient medium, although the emission measures are significantly higher in the shells. This leads us to conclude that the eROSITA bubble shells are X-ray bright because they trace denser gas, not because they are hotter. Given that the pre- and post-shock temperatures are similar and the compression ratio of the shock is high, we rule out that the bubble shells trace adiabatic shocks, in contrast to what was assumed in previous studies. We also observe non-solar Ne/O and Mg/O ratios in the shells, favouring stellar feedback models for the formation of the bubbles and settling a long-standing debate on their origin.},

IllustrisTNG is a suite of large volume, cosmological, gravo-magnetohydrodynamical simulations run with the moving-mesh code Arepo. TNG includes a comprehensive model for galaxy formation physics, and each TNG simulation self-consistently solves for the coupled evolution of dark matter, cosmic gas, luminous stars, and supermassive blackholes from early time to the present day, z=0. Each of the flagship runs -- TNG50, TNG100, and TNG300 -- are accompanied by lower-resolution and dark-matter only counterparts, and we discuss scientific and numerical cautions and caveats relevant when using TNG. Full volume snapshots are available at 100 redshifts; halo and subhalo catalogs at each snapshot and merger trees are also released. The data volume now directly accessible online is {\textasciitilde}1.1 PB, including 2,000 full volume snapshots and {\textasciitilde}110,000 high time-resolution subbox snapshots. Data access and analysis examples are available in IDL, Python, and Matlab. We describe improvements and new functionality in the web-based API, including on-demand visualization and analysis of galaxies and halos, exploratory plotting of scaling relations and other relationships between galactic and halo properties, and a new JupyterLab interface. This provides an online, browser-based, near-native data analysis platform which supports user computation with fully local access to TNG data, alleviating the need to download large simulated datasets.},

	abstract = {The TNG50 cosmological simulation produces X-ray emitting bubbles, shells, and cavities in the circumgalactic gas above and below the stellar disks of Milky Way- and Andromeda-like galaxies with morphological features reminiscent of the eROSITA and Fermi bubbles in the Galaxy. Two-thirds of the 198 MW/M31 analogues inspected in TNG50 at z=0 show one or more large-scale, coherent features of over-pressurized gas that impinge into the gaseous halo. Some of the galaxies include a succession of bubbles or shells of increasing size, ranging from a few to many tens of kpc. These are prominent in gas pressure, X-ray emission and gas temperature, and often exhibit sharp boundaries with typical shock Mach numbers of 2-4. The gas in the bubbles outflows with maximum (95th pctl) radial velocities of 100-1500 km/s. TNG50 bubbles expand with speeds as high as 1000-2000 km/s (about 1-2 kpc/Myr), but with a great diversity and with larger bubbles expanding at slower speeds. The bubble gas is at 10{\textasciicircum}6.4-7.2 K temperatures and is enriched to metallicities of 0.5-2 solar. In TNG50, the bubbles are a manifestation of episodic, kinetic, wind-like energy injections from the supermassive black holes at the galaxy centers that accrete at low Eddington ratios. According to TNG50, X-ray, and possibly gamma-ray, bubbles similar to those observed in the Milky Way should be a frequent feature of disk-like galaxies prior to, or on the verge of, being quenched. They should be within the grasp of eROSITA in the local Universe.},

	abstract = {We simulate the assembly of a massive rich cluster and the formation of its constituent galaxies in a flat, low-density universe. Our most accurate model follows the collapse, the star formation history and the orbital motion of all galaxies more luminous than the Fornax dwarf spheroidal, while dark halo structure is tracked consistently throughout the cluster for all galaxies more luminous than the SMC. Within its virial radius this model contains about 2×107 dark matter particles and almost 5000 distinct dynamically resolved galaxies. Simulations of this same cluster at a variety of resolutions allow us to check explicitly for numerical convergence both of the dark matter structures produced by our new parallel N-body and substructure identification codes, and of the galaxy populations produced by the phenomenological models we use to follow cooling, star formation, feedback and stellar aging. This baryonic modelling is tuned so that our simulations reproduce the observed properties of isolated spirals outside clusters. Without further parameter adjustment our simulations then produce a luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio, luminosity, number and velocity dispersion profiles, and a morphology-radius relation which are similar to those observed in real clusters. In particular, since our simulations follow galaxy merging explicitly, we can demonstrate that it accounts quantitatively for the observed cluster population of bulges and elliptical galaxies.},

We update the baryon census in the (H i) Lyα forest and warm-hot IGM (WHIM) at 105–6 K traced by O vi λ1032, 1038 absorption. From Enzo cosmological simulations of heating, cooling, and metal transport, we improve the H i and O vi baryon surveys using spatially averaged corrections for metallicity (Z/Z☉) and ionization fractions (fH i, fO vi). Statistically, the O vi correction product correlates with column density, (Z/Z☉)fO vi ≈ (0.015)(NO vi/1014 cm−2)0.70, with an NO vi-weighted mean of 0.01, which doubles previous estimates of WHIM baryon content. We also update the Lyα forest contribution to baryon density out to z = 0.4, correcting for the (1 + z)3 increase in absorber density, the (1 + z)4.4 rise in photoionizing background, and cosmological proper length dℓ/dz. We find substantial baryon fractions in the photoionized Lyα forest (28\% ± 11\%) and WHIM traced by O vi and broad-Lyα absorbers (25\% ± 8\%). The collapsed phase (galaxies, groups, clusters, CGM) contains 18\% ± 4\%, leaving an apparent baryon shortfall of 29\% ± 13\%. Our simulations suggest that ∼15\% reside in hotter WHIM (T ⩾ 106 K). Additional baryons could be detected in weaker Lyα and O vi absorbers. Further progress requires higher-precision baryon surveys of weak absorbers, down to minimum column densities NH i ⩾ 1012.0 cm−2, NO vi ⩾ 1012.5 cm−2, NO vii ⩾ 1014.5 cm−2, using high signal-to-noise data from high-resolution UV and X-ray spectrographs.},

	abstract = {The combination of seven-year data from WMAP and improved astrophysical data rigorously tests the standard cosmological model and places new constraints on its basic parameters and extensions. By combining the WMAP data with the latest distance measurements from the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies and the Hubble constant (H0) measurement, we determine the parameters of the simplest six-parameter ΛCDM model. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is ns = 0.968 ± 0.012 (68\% CL) for this data combination, a measurement that excludes the Harrison–Zel'dovich–Peebles spectrum by 99.5\% CL. The other parameters, including those beyond the minimal set, are also consistent with, and improved from, the five-year results. We find no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The seven-year temperature power spectrum gives a better determination of the third acoustic peak, which results in a better determination of the redshift of the matter-radiation equality epoch. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, ∑mν {\textless} 0.58 eV(95\%CL), and the effective number of neutrino species, Neff = 4.34+0.86−0.88 (68\% CL), which benefit from better determinations of the third peak and H0. The limit on a constant dark energy equation of state parameter from WMAP+BAO+H0, without high-redshift Type Ia supernovae, is w = −1.10 ± 0.14 (68\% CL). We detect the effect of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis by measuring Yp = 0.326 ± 0.075 (68\% CL). We detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of physical processes at z = 1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations. The seven-year polarization data have significantly improved: we now detect the temperature–E-mode polarization cross power spectrum at 21σ, compared with 13σ from the five-year data. With the seven-year temperature–B-mode cross power spectrum, the limit on a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has improved by 38\% to (68\% CL). We report significant detections of the Sunyaev–Zel'dovich (SZ) effect at the locations of known clusters of galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from the X-ray data on a cluster-by-cluster basis. However, it is a factor of 0.5–0.7 times the predictions from “universal profile” of Arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamical simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically expected SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope Collaboration.},

In March 2013, ESA and the Planck Collaboration released the initial cosmology products based on the first 15.5 months of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data, along with a set of scientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. This paper gives an overview of the mission and its performance, the processing, analysis, and characteristics of the data, the scientific results, and the science data products and papers in the release. The science products include maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and diffuse extragalactic foregrounds, a catalogue of compact Galactic and extragalactic sources, and a list of sources detected through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. The likelihood code used to assess cosmological models against the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data and a lensing likelihood are described. Scientific results include robust support for the standard six-parameter ΛCDM model of cosmology and improved measurements of its parameters, including a highly significant deviation from scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} values for these parameters and others derived from them are significantly different from those previously determined. Several large-scale anomalies in the temperature distribution of the CMB, first detected by WMAP, are confirmed with higher confidence. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and has measured gravitational lensing of CMB anisotropies at greater than 25{\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} finds no evidence for non-Gaussianity in the CMB. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater}’s results agree well with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} finds a lower Hubble constant than found in some more local measures. Some tension is also present between the amplitude of matter fluctuations ({\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}8{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) derived from CMB data and that derived from Sunyaev-Zeldovich data. The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and WMAP power spectra are offset from each other by an average level of about 2\% around the first acoustic peak. Analysis of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} polarization data is not yet mature, therefore polarization results are not released, although the robust detection of {\textless}i{\textgreater}E{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-mode polarization around CMB hot and cold spots is shown graphically.},

In particular, we detail an upgraded version of the cosmic microwave background likelihood that is based on angular power spectra and relies on a physical modeling of the foreground residuals in the spectral domain. This new version of the likelihood retains a larger sky fraction (up to 75{\textbackslash},{\textless}!PCT!{\textgreater}) and uses an extended multipole range. Using this likelihood, along with measurements from we derived constraints on parameters that are in good agreement with previous 2018 results, but with smaller uncertainties by 10{\textbackslash},{\textless}!PCT!{\textgreater} to 20{\textbackslash},{\textless}!PCT!{\textgreater}. We demonstrate that the foregrounds can be accurately described in the spectral domain, with a negligible impact on parameters. We also derived constraints on single-parameter extensions to including and Noteworthy results from this updated analysis include a lensing amplitude value of \$ which is more closely aligned with theoretical expectations within the framework. Additionally, our curvature measurement, \$ 0.010\$, is now fully consistent with a flat universe and our measurement of \$S\_8\$ is closer to the measurements derived from large-scale structure surveys (at the 1.5{\textbackslash},sigma level). We also added constraints from PR4 lensing, making this combination the most tightly constrained data set currently available from Additionally, we explored the addition of baryon acoustic oscillation data, which tightens the limits on some particular extensions to the standard cosmology.},

	abstract = {I highlight some of the major issues critical to the inventory of baryons at redshift z = 0. Through a combination of theoretical predictions and UV/X-ray observations, astronomers have discovered that a substantial fraction of this matter resides in the intergalactic medium (IGM) at temperatures ranging from 104 K to 107 K. The IGM is almost certainly a multi-phase medium, with several sources of heating and ionization. Hubble and FUSE observations of low-redshift Ly-alpha and OVI absorbers can account for 40-50\% of these low-z baryons, with perhaps 30-40\% in the Ly-alpha forest and 5-10\% in gas at 105-6 K seen in OVI. X-ray studies of OVII and OVIII absorption are beginning to show promise in detecting even hotter gas (106-7 K), but their utility is hindered by weak detections, uncertain metallicities, and ionization corrections. The observed ratio, N(HI)/N(OVI), typically ranges from 0.1-10. The kinematic association of the Ly-alpha and OVI absorption suggests that they may "double-count" a portion of the photoionized gas. Therefore, estimates of the baryon content in the IGM, in galaxies, and in higher-column density HI absorbers must be regarded as undetermined according to expectations of precision measurements.},

We analyzed 650 Lyα absorbers over redshift path length Δ z = 5.27, detecting numerous absorbers: 83 O VI systems, 39 C III, 53 Si III, 24 C IV, 24 N V, and so on. In the low-z IGM, we have accounted for {\textasciitilde}40\% of the baryons: 30\% in the photoionized Lyα forest and 10\% in the (T = 105-106) WHIM traced by O VI. Statistical metallicities are consistent with the canonical value of 10\% solar, with considerable scatter. Improved statistics for weak absorbers allows us to estimate ΩWHIM/Ωb = 0.073 +/- 0.008 down to log NO VI = 13.4 and 0.086 +/- 0.008 down to log NO VI = 13.0. The O VI absorber line frequency, dScript N/dz = 40-8+14, down to 10 mÅ equivalent width suggests a 250-300 kpc extent of metals around dwarf galaxies. Many absorbers appear to contain multiphase gas, with both collisional ionization and photoionization determining the ionization state. N V absorption is well correlated with O VI, and both ions show similarly steep power-law indices dScript N/dz propto N-β with βO VI ≈ βN V ≈ 2 while βH I. We conclude that O VI and N V are reliable tracers of the portion of the WHIM at T ≈ 105-106 K. C IV may be present in both collisional and photoionized phases; NC IV correlates poorly with both NH I and NO VI and βH I {\textless} βC IV {\textless} βO VI. The ions C III, Si III, and Si IV are well correlated with H I and show patterns typical of photoionization.

We identify ∼260 000 LRG pairs in the DR12 catalogue that lie within 6–10 \$h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}\$ of each other in tangential direction and within 6 \$h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{Mpc\}\$ in radial direction. We stack pairs by rotating and scaling the angular positions of each LRG so they lie on a common reference frame, then we subtract a circularly symmetric halo from each member of the pair to search for a residual signal between the pair members. We find a statistically significant (5.3σ) signal between LRG pairs in the stacked data with a magnitude Δy = (1.31 ± 0.25) × 10−8. The uncertainty is estimated from two Monte Carlo null tests which also establish the reliability of our analysis. Assuming a simple, isothermal, cylindrical filament model of electron overdensity with a radial density profile proportional to rc/r (as determined from simulations), where r is the perpendicular distance from the cylinder axis and rc is the core radius of the density profile, we constrain the product of overdensity and filament temperature to be \${\textbackslash}delta \_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ c\} {\textbackslash}times (T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm e\}/10{\textasciicircum}7 {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm K\}) {\textbackslash}times (r\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ c\}/0.5h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}) = 2.7 {\textbackslash}pm 0.5\$. To our knowledge, this is the first detection of filamentary gas at overdensities typical of cosmological large-scale structure. We compare our result to the BAHAMAS suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (McCarthy et al. 2017) and find a slightly lower, but marginally consistent Comptonization excess, Δy = (0.84 ± 0.24) × 10−8.},

	abstract = {We present two numerical schemes for passive tracer particles in the hydrodynamical moving-mesh code AREPO, and compare their performance for various problems, from simple set-ups to cosmological simulations. The purpose of tracer particles is to allow the flow to be followed in a Lagrangian way, tracing the evolution of the fluid with time, and allowing the thermodynamical history of individual fluid parcels to be recorded. We find that the commonly used `velocity field tracers', which are advected using the fluid velocity field, do not in general follow the mass flow correctly, and explain why this is the case. This method can result in order-of-magnitude biases in simulations of driven turbulence and in cosmological simulations, rendering the velocity field tracers inappropriate for following these flows. We then discuss a novel implementation of `Monte Carlo tracers', which are moved along with fluid cells and are exchanged probabilistically between them following the mass flux. This method reproduces the mass distribution of the fluid correctly. The main limitation of this approach is that it is more diffusive than the fluid itself. Nonetheless, we show that this novel approach is more reliable than that has been employed previously and demonstrate that it is appropriate for following hydrodynamical flows in mesh-based codes. The Monte Carlo tracers can also naturally be transferred between fluid cells and other types of particles, such as stellar particles, so that the mass flow in cosmological simulations can be followed in its entirety.},

	abstract = {Galaxy clusters are important probes for both cosmology and galaxy formation physics. We test the cosmological, hydrodynamical FLAMINGO simulations by comparing to observations of the gaseous properties of clusters measured from X-ray observations. FLAMINGO contains unprecedented numbers of massive galaxy groups (\${\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}6\$) and clusters (\${\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}5\$) and includes variations in both cosmology and galaxy formation physics. We predict the evolution of cluster scaling relations as well as radial profiles of the temperature, density, pressure, entropy, and metallicity for different masses and redshifts. We show that the differences between volume-, and X-ray-weighting of particles in the simulations, and between cool-core non cool-core samples, are similar in size as the differences between simulations for which the stellar and AGN feedback has been calibrated to produce significantly different gas fractions. Compared to thermally-driven AGN feedback, kinetic jet feedback calibrated to produce the same gas fraction at \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm 500c\}\$ yields a hotter core with higher entropies and lower densities, which translates into a smaller fraction of cool-core clusters. Stronger feedback, calibrated to produce lower gas fractions and hence lower gas densities, results in higher temperatures, entropies, and metallicities, but lower pressures. The scaling relations and thermodynamic profiles show almost no evolution with respect to self-similar expectations, except for the metallicity decreasing with redshift. We find that the temperature, density, pressure, and entropy profiles of clusters in the fiducial FLAMINGO simulation are in excellent agreement with observations, while the metallicities in the core are too high.},

	abstract = {The distribution of metals in the intra-cluster medium (ICM) encodes important information about the enrichment history and formation of galaxy clusters. Here, we explore the metal content of clusters in IllustrisTNG - a new suite of galaxy formation simulations building on the Illustris project. Our cluster sample contains 20 objects in TNG100 - a ∼(100 Mpc)3 volume simulation with 2 × 18203 resolution elements, and 370 objects in TNG300 - a ∼(300 Mpc)3 volume simulation with 2 × 25003 resolution elements. The z = 0 metallicity profiles agree with observations, and the enrichment history is consistent with observational data going beyond z ∼ 1, showing nearly no metallicity evolution. The abundance profiles vary only minimally within the cluster samples, especially in the outskirts with a relative scatter of ∼ 15 per cent. The average metallicity profile flattens towards the centre, where we find a logarithmic slope of -0.1 compared to -0.5 in the outskirts. Cool core clusters have more centrally peaked metallicity profiles (∼0.8 solar) compared to non-cool core systems (∼0.5 solar), similar to observational trends. Si/Fe and O/Fe radial profiles follow positive gradients. The outer abundance profiles do not evolve below z ∼ 2, whereas the inner profiles flatten towards z = 0. More than ∼ 80 per cent of the metals in the ICM have been accreted from the proto-cluster environment, which has been enriched to ∼0.1 solar already at z ∼ 2. We conclude that the intra-cluster metal distribution is uniform among our cluster sample, nearly time-invariant in the outskirts for more than 10 Gyr, and forms through a universal enrichment history.},

	abstract = {The gas surrounding galaxies outside their disks or interstellar medium and inside their virial radii is known as the circumgalactic medium (CGM). In recent years this component of galaxies has assumed an important role in our understanding of galaxy evolution owing to rapid advances in observational access to this diffuse, nearly invisible material. Observations and simulations of this component of galaxies suggest that it is a multiphase medium characterized by rich dynamics and complex ionization states. The CGM is a source for a galaxy's star-forming fuel, the venue for galactic feedback and recycling, and perhaps the key regulator of the galactic gas supply. We review our evolving knowledge of the CGM with emphasis on its mass, dynamical state, and coevolution with galaxies. Observations from all redshifts and from across the electromagnetic spectrum indicate that CGM gas has a key role in galaxy evolution. We summarize the state of this field and pose unanswered questions for future research.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the ﬁrst cosmological results based on Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and lensing-potential power spectra. We ﬁnd that the Planck spectra at high multipoles ( {\textgreater}∼ 40) are extremely well described by the standard spatiallyﬂat six-parameter ΛCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations. Within the context of this cosmology, the Planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision: the angular size of the sound horizon at recombination, the physical densities of baryons and cold dark matter, and the scalar spectral index are estimated to be θ∗ = (1.04147 ± 0.00062) × 10−2, Ωbh2 = 0.02205 ± 0.00028, Ωch2 = 0.1199 ± 0.0027, and ns = 0.9603 ± 0.0073, respectively (note that in this abstract we quote 68\% errors on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters). For this cosmology, we ﬁnd a low value of the Hubble constant, H0 = (67.3 ± 1.2) km s−1 Mpc−1, and a high value of the matter density parameter, Ωm = 0.315 ± 0.017. These values are in tension with recent direct measurements of H0 and the magnituderedshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, but are in excellent agreement with geometrical constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including curvature, we ﬁnd that the Universe is consistent with spatial ﬂatness to percent level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We use high-resolution CMB data together with Planck to provide greater control on extragalactic foreground components in an investigation of extensions to the six-parameter ΛCDM model. We present selected results from a large grid of cosmological models, using a range of additional astrophysical data sets in addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are favoured over the standard six-parameter ΛCDM cosmology. The deviation of the scalar spectral index from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes in the matter content of the Universe. We ﬁnd an upper limit of r0.002 {\textless} 0.11 on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like relativistic particles beyond the three families of neutrinos in the standard model. Using BAO and CMB data, we ﬁnd Neﬀ = 3.30 ± 0.27 for the eﬀective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, and an upper limit of 0.23 eV for the sum of neutrino masses. Our results are in excellent agreement with big bang nucleosynthesis and the standard value of Neﬀ = 3.046. We ﬁnd no evidence for dynamical dark energy; using BAO and CMB data, the dark energy equation of state parameter is constrained to be w = −1.13+−00..1130. We also use the Planck data to set limits on a possible variation of the ﬁne-structure constant, dark matter annihilation and primordial magnetic ﬁelds. Despite the success of the six-parameter ΛCDM model in describing the Planck data at high multipoles, we note that this cosmology does not provide a good ﬁt to the temperature power spectrum at low multipoles. The unusual shape of the spectrum in the multipole range 20 {\textless}∼ {\textless}∼ 40 was seen previously in the WMAP data and is a real feature of the primordial CMB anisotropies. The poor ﬁt to the spectrum at low multipoles is not of decisive signiﬁcance, but is an “anomaly” in an otherwise self-consistent analysis of the Planck temperature data.},

	abstract = {We study the implications of Planck data for models of dark energy (DE) and modiﬁed gravity (MG) beyond the standard cosmological constant scenario. We start with cases where the DE only directly aﬀects the background evolution, considering Taylor expansions of the equation of state w(a), as well as principal component analysis and parameterizations related to the potential of a minimally coupled DE scalar ﬁeld. When estimating the density of DE at early times, we signiﬁcantly improve present constraints and ﬁnd that it has to be below ∼2\% (at 95\% conﬁdence) of the critical density, even when forced to play a role for z {\textless} 50 only. We then move to general parameterizations of the DE or MG perturbations that encompass both eﬀective ﬁeld theories and the phenomenology of gravitational potentials in MG models. Lastly, we test a range of speciﬁc models, such as k-essence, f (R) theories, and coupled DE. In addition to the latest Planck data, for our main analyses, we use background constraints from baryonic acoustic oscillations, type-Ia supernovae, and local measurements of the Hubble constant. We further show the impact of measurements of the cosmological perturbations, such as redshift-space distortions and weak gravitational lensing. These additional probes are important tools for testing MG models and for breaking degeneracies that are still present in the combination of Planck and background data sets. All results that include only background parameterizations (expansion of the equation of state, early DE, general potentials in minimally-coupled scalar ﬁelds or principal component analysis) are in agreement with ΛCDM. When testing models that also change perturbations (even when the background is ﬁxed to ΛCDM), some tensions appear in a few scenarios: the maximum one found is ∼2σ for Planck TT+lowP when parameterizing observables related to the gravitational potentials with a chosen time dependence; the tension increases to, at most, 3σ when external data sets are included. It however disappears when including CMB lensing.},

	abstract = {Previous simulations of the growth of cosmic structures have broadly reproduced the ‘cosmic web’ of galaxies that we see in the Universe, but failed to create a mixed population of elliptical and spiral galaxies, because of numerical inaccuracies and incomplete physical models. Moreover, they were unable to track the small-scale evolution of gas and stars to the present epoch within a representative portion of the Universe. Here we report a simulation that starts 12 million years after the Big Bang, and traces 13 billion years of cosmic evolution with 12 billion resolution elements in a cube of 106.5 megaparsecs a side. It yields a reasonable population of ellipticals and spirals, reproduces the observed distribution of galaxies in clusters and characteristics of hydrogen on large scales, and at the same time matches the ‘metal’ and hydrogen content of galaxies on small scales.},

	abstract = {The X-ray bright bubbles at the Galactic Centre provide an opportunity to understand the effects of feedback on galaxy evolution. The shells of the eROSITA bubbles show enhanced X-ray emission over the sky background. Previously, these shells were assumed to have a single temperature component and to trace the shock-heated lower-temperature halo gas. Using Suzaku observations, we show that the X-ray emission of the shells is more complex and best described by a two-temperature thermal model: one component close to the Galaxy’s virial temperature and the other at supervirial temperatures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that temperatures of the virial and supervirial components are similar in the shells and in the ambient medium, although the emission measures are significantly higher in the shells. This leads us to conclude that the eROSITA bubble shells are X-ray bright because they trace denser gas, not because they are hotter. Given that the pre- and postshock temperatures are similar and the compression ratio of the shock is high, we rule out that the bubble shells trace adiabatic shocks, in contrast to what was assumed in previous studies. We also observe non-solar Ne/O and Mg/O ratios in the shells, favouring stellar feedback models for the formation of the bubbles and settling a long-standing debate on their origin.},
